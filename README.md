        1. How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I can ensure that my code, program, and software is more functional and secure by making sure to strictly follow security recommendations, regulations, and guidelines. We can do this by taking somewhat simple steps, consistently, making sure that risk is mitigated, common errors are checked for and fixed, and that secure coding practices from companies like OWASP are referenced and accounted for in the work.

        2. How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
We should interpret and build the program based on user needs and requirements from the ground up. If these are things that we only try to account for when they start to matter, then a large portion of money and time will be wasted on reworks of the program instead of towards fulfilling the goals we set for ourselves. We can also incorporate changing needs into the SDLC and optimize for creation and deployment of said needs.

        3. How do I approach designing software?	
I like to approach designing software in a systematic way, one too many times have I started a game project on Unity without enough foresight, so I’ve been forced to make a change in my methodology. Now I first make macro plans before filling them in with micro plans, essentially the mapping user stories method that we’ve been taught about the SDLC.
